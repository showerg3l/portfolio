            <p>
                I believe development is a team effort, it doesn't matter if you working on a solo project or building
                an enterprise application. It's likely you're working with something that someone helped make, be that 
                your Hardware, IDE or another react component. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of that teamwork is morale, and in the UK the main source of boosting morale is with caffine, in 
                2 main sources, tea and coffee. When making our favourite concoction its good etiquette to also offer
                your fellow colleagues a drink. But some people are better at this than others. Sometimes people just
                need a little nudge to motivate them into the team spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the purpose of Teaflip, to provide a nudge with the level of passive aggressiveness that only
                a computer can deliver. It tracks the number of cups each person has drank and the number of rounds 
                of drinks they have made. The system adds weight to each person inversely proportional to difference
                between the two, making it more likely for someone who has drank a lot of cups but hasn't made many
                rounds to be chosen.
